            <h3>About Me</h3>

            <img id="bio-image" src="images/Me.jpg" alt="Anna Nichols">

            <p>I first got a degree in Sociology before realizing that Social Work really wasn't for me. After that I
                spent a year getting a Geology degree which was much more enjoyable. From spending too much time in
                Geology labs, I developed a love for minerals (Jesus Christ Marie, they're not rocks! They're
                MINERALS!). I also learned about terrior and the effects soil and rock composition has on wine. The best part of that class though was learning how to make wine which tasted pretty good for something made in the basement of a science building.</p> 
                
            <p>Now I'm beginning my journey to become a full stack developer which is kind of hilarious since even before I started college my parents were telling me to go into something computer related. Of course, being young I thought I knew better and didn't listen. Now years later I'm finding out they were right all along.</p>
